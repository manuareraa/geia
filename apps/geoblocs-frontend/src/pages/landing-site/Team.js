          The team behind Geoblocs is a network of individuals, institutions,
          companies, non profits and indigenous groups all with a passion to
          find ways to regenerate our biosphere. Because it is structured this
          way there are low overheads making it possible to use the funds to the
          greatest benefit as each part of the network is only being rewarded
          for work being carried out by them at that time. The entire platform
          is run on the same principal from the IT people to the people doing
          the work on the ground. Geoblocs is administered by GEIA who, like all
          other stakeholders works on a commission basis.

          Sustainable Development Goals in harmony.
